🤖 AI Voice Assistant (Python)

An AI-powered voice assistant built using Python that combines **speech recognition, text-to-speech, a graphical user interface, and a Large Language Model (LLM)** to handle voice commands and answer user queries in real time.

This project was developed to gain hands-on experience with **AI integration, voice-based interaction, and desktop application development**.

▶️ How the Application Works
1. The assistant continuously listens for a wake word.
2. Once activated, it captures the user’s voice command.
3. Simple commands are handled directly (e.g., opening websites).
4. Complex queries are sent to the Gemini AI model for processing.
5. The response is displayed on the GUI and spoken aloud using text-to-speech.
